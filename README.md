# ML-Implements
A place I store/document:
	Implementions of machine learning algorithms I'm learning about.
	Projects using these implementations.

Done so far:
  Decision tree: basic (binary) decision tree and multi-decision tree.
  K-Nearest-Neighbor: basic implementation of K-Nearest-Neighbor.
  K-Means: basic implementation of K-Means.
