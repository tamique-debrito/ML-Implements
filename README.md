# ML-Implements
A place I store/document:
	Implementions of machine learning algorithms I'm learning about.
	Projects using these implementations.

Done so far:
  Decision tree - binary decision tree and multi-decision tree.
  K-Nearest-Neighbor
  K-Means
  Perceptron/linear regression via gradient descent
